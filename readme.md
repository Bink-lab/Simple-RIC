You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests tk
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `main.py` file in a text editor or an IDE of your choice.

## Portable Executable (.exe)

For a more portable and user-friendly experience, you can use the `main.exe` file in the `dist` folder. This file is created using PyInstaller, which bundles the Python script along with its dependencies into a single executable file.

**Note:** The `main.exe` file may appear larger in size compared to the `main.py` file. This is because PyInstaller includes all the necessary libraries and dependencies required to run the script, ensuring that the application can be run on any system without the need to install additional packages.

To use the `main.exe` file, simply double-click on it, and follow the on-screen prompts to enter a Roblox username and choose whether to save the data to a .txt file.
